The Pi0W Hydraulic Functions & Operators Framework provides a comprehensive mathematical foundation for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing water distribution systems. This framework incorporates advanced fluid dynamics, gravitational effects, and pipe-specific characteristics to enable precise hydraulic calculations and system optimization.

## 2. PIPE TYPE CLASSIFICATION AND PROPERTIES

### 2.1 Pipe Type Taxonomy

Pipes are classified according to a hierarchical taxonomy:

$$ P = \{P_{material}, P_{diameter}, P_{class}, P_{age}, P_{coating}\} $$

Where each component represents a specific property of the pipe.

### 2.2 Material-Specific Properties

Each pipe material has specific properties affecting flow characteristics:
