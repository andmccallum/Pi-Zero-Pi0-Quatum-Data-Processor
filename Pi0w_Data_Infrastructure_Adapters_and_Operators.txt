## 8. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION FOR DATA FILTERING

The core mathematical foundation for the lightweight data filter is based on the following principles:

### 8.1 Minimal Data Extraction
From any input data source, we extract the minimal set of features:
$$ \Phi_{min}(d) = \{C, L, p_{avg}, f_{avg}, t_{patterns}\} $$
where:
- $C$ is total consumption
- $L$ is total pipe length
- $p_{avg}$ is average pressure
- $f_{avg}$ is average flow
- $t_{patterns}$ are temporal usage patterns

### 8.2 Efficiency-Based Filtering
The primary filter uses the efficiency metric:
$$ \eta = rac{C}{L} $$

This is enhanced with a normalized deviation measure:
$$ \delta_{\eta} = rac{\eta - \eta_{expected}}{\eta_{expected}} $$

### 8.3 Anomaly Flagging
Potential anomalies are flagged using:
$$ \mathrm{Flag}(A) = egin{cases}
1 & 	ext{if } |\delta_{\eta}| > 	au_{\eta} \
0 & 	ext{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$
where $	au_{\eta}$ is an adaptive threshold.

### 8.4 Preliminary Simulation
Even with minimal data, a simplified simulation can be run:
$$ \mathrm{Sim}(S) = rac{f_{sim} - f_{measured}}{f_{measured}} $$
where $f_{sim}$ is derived from a basic network model.

### 8.5 Composite Filter Function
The complete filter function combines these elements:
$$ \mathcal{F}(d) = lpha \cdot \delta_{\eta} + eta \cdot \mathrm{Flag}(A) + \gamma \cdot \mathrm{Sim}(S) $$

With adaptive weights:
$$ lpha = lpha_0 \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda_{lpha} \cdot n}) $$
$$ eta = eta_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda_{eta} \cdot n} $$
$$ \gamma = \gamma_0 \cdot (1 - e^{-\lambda_{\gamma} \cdot n}) $$

where $n$ is the amount of available data, and $\lambda$ parameters control adaptation rates.

### 8.6 Cumulative Refinement
As more data becomes available, the filter evolves:
$$ \mathcal{F}_t(d) = \mathcal{F}_{t-1}(d) + \Delta\mathcal{F}(d_t) $$

where $\Delta\mathcal{F}(d_t)$ represents the incremental improvement from new data $d_t$.
