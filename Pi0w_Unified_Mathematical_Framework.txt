# Pi0w Unified Mathematical Framework

## 1. FOUNDATIONAL OPERATORS

### 1.1 Signal Representation Operator
The water flow signal is represented as a function of time:

$$ f(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i \cos(2\pi f_i t + \phi_i) + \epsilon(t) $$

Where:
- $$ A_i $$ are amplitudes
- $$ f_i $$ are frequencies
- $$ \phi_i $$ are phase shifts
- $$ \epsilon(t) $$ captures noise and small variations

### 1.2 Fractal Decomposition Operator
The fractal decomposition operator captures self-similar characteristics in water flow signals:

$$ F(f(t)) = \left\{ f_{scale}(t) : t \in [t_0, t_1] \right\} $$

Where $$ f_{scale}(t) $$ represents the signal component at a specific fractal resolution.

### 1.3 Harmonic Decomposition Operator
The harmonic decomposition operator applies Fourier transform methods:

$$ H(f(t)) = \mathcal{F}\{ f(t) \} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-2\pi i \omega t} dt $$

This yields a harmonic spectrum revealing dominant frequencies.

### 1.4 Time Frame Shifting Operator
The time shift operator analyzes dynamic changes in the signal:

$$ T_\tau(f(t)) = f(t + \tau) $$

We observe differences between successive time frames:

$$ \Delta f(t) = f(t) - f(t-\Delta t) $$

Where $$ \Delta t $$ is the frame rate period.
