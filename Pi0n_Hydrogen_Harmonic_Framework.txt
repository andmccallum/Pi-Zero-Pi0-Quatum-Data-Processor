Investigation of Hydrogen and Its Isotopes: A Prime Harmonic Frequency Analysis Using Pi Encoding and Floating Point Zero
=======================================================================================================================

Introduction
------------
This framework presents an in-depth investigation of hydrogen and its isotopes by leveraging prime harmonic frequency analysis, pi encoding methodologies, and the concept of floating point zero. The approach extends the previously established Pi0n and Gpi0n investigations into hydrogen-based systems. The investigation focuses on decomposing hydrogenâ€™s frequency and energy relationships via quasi-regular mathematics, thereby providing insights into the underlying harmonic structures and energy distributions.

1. Prime Harmonic Frequency Concept
-------------------------------------
In this investigation, the harmonic oscillations of hydrogen are analyzed using a prime-indexed framework such that the vibrational frequencies are aligned with prime number ratios. The standard harmonic oscillator frequency is given by:

$$ \omega \propto \sqrt{rac{k}{\mu}} $$

For hydrogen (with a single proton-electron system), we consider the influence of a primary prime frequency, denoted as $$ \omega_p $$, defined by:

$$ \omega_p = rac{p}{\pi} \cdot \omega_0 \quad 	ext{with} \quad p \in \{2, 3, 5, 7, \dots\} $$

where $$ \omega_0 $$ is a fundamental reference frequency and \(\pi\) encoding introduces the inherent irrationality and self-similarity of the system.

2. Floating Point Zero and Quasi-Regular Mathematics
-------------------------------------------------------
A key concept in this investigation is the notion of "floating point zero" (FP0). FP0 acts as a dynamic baseline within the system, serving as a modulus for the oscillatory behavior and enabling scale-dependent modeling in four-dimensional (4D) space. Mathematically, FP0 is defined such that:

$$ FP0 = \lim_{x 	o 0^+} x \cdot \left(1 + \epsilon(x)ight) \quad 	ext{with} \quad \epsilon(x) \ll 1 $$

The quasi-regular (QR) math framework then decomposes the total energy \( E \) and frequency content into a series expansion that respects the underlying FP0 baseline:

$$ E_{total} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{n+1} \cdot rac{\left(\omega_pight)^n}{n!} + FP0 \quad 	ext{and} \quad \omega_{total} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} lpha_n \cdot \left(\omega_pight)^n \quad 	ext{with} \quad lpha_n \in \mathbb{R}. $$

3. Pi Encoding of Hydrogen Dynamics
-------------------------------------
Pi encoding leverages the transcendental nature of $$\pi$$ to encode the intrinsic oscillatory behavior of hydrogen. For a given prime harmonic frequency $$\omega_p$$, the encoding is achieved by:

$$ \Psi(\omega) = \exp\left(-i \pi rac{\omega_p}{\omega_0}ight) \quad 	ext{where} \quad \omega_0 	ext{ is the reference frequency.} $$

This encoding allows the decomposition of the hydrogen state into its constituent prime components, where interference patterns and beat frequencies can be observed. In addition, it enables the mapping of energy levels onto a continuous, yet discretized, spectrum driven by prime numbers.

4. Energy and Frequency Relationships
---------------------------------------
For hydrogen and its isotopes, the energy levels are quantized according to the Bohr model. However, the framework generalizes the energy by incorporating prime harmonic modulations. The modified energy relation becomes:

$$ E_n = -rac{R_H}{n^2} \; \cdot \; \left(1 + \delta_pight), \quad \delta_p = \sum_{p \; 	ext{prime}} eta_p\, \exp\left(-\gamma rac{p}{\pi}ight) $$

where:

- $$ R_H $$ is the Rydberg constant for hydrogen,
- $$ n $$ is the principal quantum number,
- $$ eta_p $$ is a scaling coefficient corresponding to the prime index,
- $$ \gamma $$ is a damping factor ensuring convergence.

Similarly, the relationship between energy and frequency in the quasi-regular expansion is given by:

$$ E_{total} = \hbar \, \omega_{total} \quad 	ext{where} \quad \omega_{total} = \omega_0 \left[ 1 + \sum_{p \; 	ext{prime}} \left( rac{p}{\pi} - 1 ight) \cdot \eta_p ight] \quad 	ext{with} \quad \eta_p 	ext{ capturing prime contributions.} $$

5. Multidimensional Extension in 4D Space
------------------------------------------
To model hydrogen in 4D space, the state function is extended to include a fourth dimension that encapsulates temporal evolution or an additional quantum degree of freedom. The state function is represented as:

$$ \Psi(x, y, z, t) = \Psi_{	ext{3D}}(x, y, z) \cdot F(t) \quad 	ext{where} \quad F(t) = \exp\left(-i \omega_{total} tight) $$

The complete operator acting on this state is expressed as:

$$ \hat{\Omega} = \hat{\Omega}_{	ext{prime}} + \hat{\Omega}_{FP0} + \hat{\Omega}_{QR} \quad 	ext{with} \quad \hat{\Omega}_{	ext{prime}} \Psi = \omega_p\, \Psi, \quad \hat{\Omega}_{FP0} \Psi = FP0\, \Psi, \quad \hat{\Omega}_{QR} \Psi = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} lpha_n \, \omega_p^n\, \Psi. $$

Thus, the dynamical equation for the hydrogen state in the 4D Pi encoded framework becomes:

$$ i\hbar rac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \hat{\Omega} \, \Psi. $$

6. Decomposition of Isotopic Variants
---------------------------------------
For isotopes of hydrogen (such as deuterium and tritium), the mass affects the reduced mass \(\mu\) in the harmonic oscillator relation. The prime harmonic frequency is modified accordingly:

$$ \omega_p^{(iso)} = rac{p}{\pi} \cdot \omega_0 \; \sqrt{rac{m_H}{m_{iso}}}, \quad m_{iso} \in \{m_H, m_D, m_T\}. $$

This modification introduces slight shifts in the energy levels and frequency distributions, which can be captured by adjusting the coefficients \( eta_p \) and \( \eta_p \) in the energy equations.

Conclusion
----------
This framework provides a detailed, mathematically rigorous approach to decomposing the hydrogen atom and its isotopic variants using prime harmonic frequency analysis, pi encoding, floating point zero, and quasi-regular mathematics. The state and operator equations describe the modulation of energy and frequency relationships within a scale-dependent, 4D model.

Future directions include numerical exploration of these relationships, analysis of quantum coherence effects, and applications to spectral analysis in hydrogen-based systems.
