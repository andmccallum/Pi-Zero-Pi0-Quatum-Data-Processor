# Pi0W User Interface & Access Control Framework

## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The Pi0W User Interface and Access Control Framework provides a comprehensive front-end system with hierarchical user permissions, continuous system state monitoring, and differentiated access controls. The framework ensures that basic system information is always visible while securing critical operations behind appropriate authentication layers.

## 2. USER INTERFACE ARCHITECTURE

### 2.1 Dual-Layer Display Model

The UI follows a dual-layer model represented by:

$$ UI = UI_{public} \cup UI_{authenticated} $$

Where:
- $UI_{public}$ represents always-visible system state information
- $UI_{authenticated}$ represents user-specific controls and data based on permissions

### 2.2 Public Layer Components

The public layer displays critical system information regardless of authentication status:

$$ UI_{public} = \{S_{critical}, A_{emergency}, N_{alerts}\} $$

Where:
- $S_{critical}$ represents critical system state indicators
- $A_{emergency}$ represents emergency shutdown controls
- $N_{alerts}$ represents system alerts and notifications

### 2.3 Authenticated Layer Components

The authenticated layer provides user-specific controls and information:

$$ UI_{authenticated}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(u) \cdot C_i $$

Where:
- $u$ is the user
- $C_i$ are UI components
- $w_i(u)$ are binary weights (0 or 1) based on user permissions

### 2.4 Responsive Layout Function

The UI layout adapts to different devices using a responsive function:

$$ L(d, u) = f_{transform}(UI_{base}, d, P(u)) $$

Where:
- $d$ is the device type (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- $P(u)$ is the permission set for user $u$
- $f_{transform}$ is a transformation function that adapts the layout

## 3. USER AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM

### 3.1 Authentication Process

The authentication process is defined by:

$$ Auth(u, c) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } H(c) = H_{stored}(u) \text{ and } MFA(u) = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $u$ is the username
- $c$ is the credential (password)
- $H$ is a secure hash function
- $H_{stored}(u)$ is the stored hash for user $u$
- $MFA(u)$ is the multi-factor authentication verification

### 3.2 Session Management

User sessions are managed through:

$$ S(u, t) = \begin{cases}
valid & \text{if } t - t_{login} < t_{timeout} \text{ and } IP(t) = IP(t_{login}) \\
invalid & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $t$ is the current time
- $t_{login}$ is the login time
- $t_{timeout}$ is the session timeout period
- $IP(t)$ is the IP address at time $t$

### 3.3 Password Security

Password security is enforced through:

$$ Strength(p) = \alpha \cdot len(p) + \beta \cdot entropy(p) + \gamma \cdot complexity(p) $$

Where:
- $p$ is the password
- $len(p)$ is the length
- $entropy(p)$ is the information entropy
- $complexity(p)$ measures character variety
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weighting factors

## 4. USER HIERARCHY AND PERMISSION MODEL

### 4.1 User Type Hierarchy

The user hierarchy is defined as a directed acyclic graph:

$$ G = (V, E) $$

Where:
- $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ is the set of user types
- $E = \{(v_i, v_j) | v_i \text{ inherits from } v_j\}$ is the set of inheritance relationships

Common user types include:
- System Administrator
- Water System Manager
- Operator
- Technician
- Analyst
- Viewer
- Emergency Responder

### 4.2 Permission Sets

Each user type has an associated permission set:

$$ P(v_i) = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_m\} $$

Where each $p_j$ is a specific permission.

The effective permissions for a user type are:

$$ P_{eff}(v_i) = P(v_i) \cup \bigcup_{(v_i, v_j) \in E} P_{eff}(v_j) $$

### 4.3 Operation-Based Permissions

Permissions for specific operations are defined by:

$$ P_{op}(u, op) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } op \in P_{eff}(type(u)) \text{ and } op \in P_{specific}(u) \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $type(u)$ is the user type of user $u$
- $P_{specific}(u)$ are user-specific permissions

### 4.4 Risk-Based Permission Adjustment

Permissions are dynamically adjusted based on risk levels:

$$ P_{adjusted}(u, op, r) = P_{op}(u, op) \cdot f_{risk}(op, r) $$

Where:
- $r$ is the current risk level
- $f_{risk}(op, r)$ is a risk adjustment function that may restrict permissions during high-risk situations

## 5. EMERGENCY ACCESS CONTROL

### 5.1 Emergency Shutdown Function

The emergency shutdown function is universally accessible:

$$ ES(u) = 1 \quad \forall u \in U $$

Where $U$ is the set of all users, including unauthenticated users.

### 5.2 Emergency Action Protocol

Emergency actions follow a protocol:

$$ EA(u, a) = \begin{cases}
execute(a) & \text{if } a \in A_{emergency} \\
log(u, a) + notify(A_{admin}) + execute(a) & \text{if } a \in A_{critical} \text{ and } P_{op}(u, a) = 1 \\
deny(a) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $a$ is the action
- $A_{emergency}$ is the set of emergency actions
- $A_{critical}$ is the set of critical actions
- $A_{admin}$ is the set of administrators

### 5.3 Escalation Procedure

Permission escalation during emergencies:

$$ P_{escalated}(u, op, e) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } e = 1 \text{ and } op \in A_{emergency} \\
P_{op}(u, op) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where $e$ indicates an emergency situation.

## 6. USER INTERFACE COMPONENTS

### 6.1 System State Dashboard

The system state dashboard displays:

$$ D_{state} = \{S_1, S_2, ..., S_k\} $$

Where each $S_i$ represents a critical system state indicator, such as:
- Water pressure
- Flow rates
- Water quality parameters
- System alerts
- Operational status

### 6.2 Control Panel

The control panel provides access to operations:

$$ C_{panel}(u) = \{op_i | P_{op}(u, op_i) = 1\} $$

Where each $op_i$ is an operation the user has permission to perform.

### 6.3 Data Visualization

Data visualization components are defined by:

$$ V_{data}(u, d) = \{v_i(d) | P_{data}(u, d) = 1\} $$

Where:
- $d$ is a dataset
- $v_i$ is a visualization function
- $P_{data}(u, d)$ indicates if user $u$ has access to dataset $d$

### 6.4 Notification System

The notification system displays alerts based on:

$$ N(u) = N_{public} \cup \{n_i | P_{notify}(u, n_i) = 1\} $$

Where:
- $N_{public}$ are public notifications
- $n_i$ are user-specific notifications
- $P_{notify}(u, n_i)$ indicates if user $u$ should receive notification $n_i$

## 7. MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS FOR UI INTERACTION

### 7.1 View Operator

The view operator determines what a user can see:

$$ \Omega_{view}(u, c) = \begin{cases}
c & \text{if } P_{view}(u, c) = 1 \text{ or } c \in UI_{public} \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $c$ is a UI component
- $P_{view}(u, c)$ indicates if user $u$ can view component $c$

### 7.2 Action Operator

The action operator determines what a user can do:

$$ \Omega_{action}(u, a, s) = \begin{cases}
execute(a, s) & \text{if } P_{op}(u, a) = 1 \text{ and } V_{constraints}(a, s) = 1 \\
deny(a) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $a$ is an action
- $s$ is the system state
- $V_{constraints}(a, s)$ validates if action $a$ is safe in state $s$

### 7.3 Data Access Operator

The data access operator controls data visibility:

$$ \Omega_{data}(u, d) = \begin{cases}
filter(d, P_{data}(u)) & \text{if } P_{data}(u, d) \neq \emptyset \\
\emptyset & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $d$ is a dataset
- $filter(d, P_{data}(u))$ applies data access filters based on permissions

### 7.4 Notification Operator

The notification operator controls alert delivery:

$$ \Omega_{notify}(u, n) = \begin{cases}
deliver(n) & \text{if } P_{notify}(u, n) = 1 \text{ or } priority(n) \geq \tau_{emergency} \\
queue(n) & \text{if } \tau_{low} \leq priority(n) < \tau_{emergency} \text{ and } P_{notify}(u, n) = 1 \\
discard(n) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $n$ is a notification
- $priority(n)$ is the notification priority
- $\tau_{emergency}$ and $\tau_{low}$ are priority thresholds

## 8. USER INTERFACE IMPLEMENTATION

### 8.1 Component Rendering Function

UI components are rendered using:

$$ R(c, u, d, s) = f_{render}(c, \Omega_{view}(u, c), \Omega_{data}(u, d), s) $$

Where:
- $c$ is a component
- $d$ is the associated data
- $s$ is the system state
- $f_{render}$ is the rendering function

### 8.2 Event Handling Function

User events are processed through:

$$ E(e, u, s) = \begin{cases}
\Omega_{action}(u, action(e), s) & \text{if } e \text{ is an action event} \\
update(UI, e) & \text{if } e \text{ is a UI event} \\
log(e) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $e$ is an event
- $action(e)$ extracts the action from an event
- $update(UI, e)$ updates the UI based on the event

### 8.3 Responsive Adaptation Function

The UI adapts to different devices through:

$$ A(UI, d, u) = \{transform(c, d, P(u)) | c \in UI\} $$

Where:
- $d$ is the device type
- $transform(c, d, P(u))$ adapts component $c$ for device $d$ based on permissions

## 9. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### 9.1 Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using:

$$ V_{input}(i, t) = \begin{cases}
i & \text{if } validate(i, t) = 1 \\
sanitize(i) & \text{if } partial\_validate(i, t) = 1 \\
reject(i) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $i$ is the input
- $t$ is the expected input type
- $validate$, $partial\_validate$, and $sanitize$ are validation functions

### 9.2 Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection

CSRF protection is implemented through:

$$ CSRF(r) = \begin{cases}
allow(r) & \text{if } token(r) = token(session) \\
deny(r) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $r$ is a request
- $token(r)$ is the token in the request
- $token(session)$ is the token in the session

### 9.3 Audit Logging

All user actions are logged:

$$ L(u, a, t, r) = log(user: u, action: a, time: t, result: r) $$

Where:
- $u$ is the user
- $a$ is the action
- $t$ is the time
- $r$ is the result

## 10. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
