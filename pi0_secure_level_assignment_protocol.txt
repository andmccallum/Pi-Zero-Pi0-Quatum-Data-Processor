PI0 SYSTEM: SECURE LEVEL ASSIGNMENT PROTOCOL WITH RISK-BASED INFORMATION SHARING
=======================================================================

INTRODUCTION
-----------
This document establishes a secure level assignment protocol for the Pi0 system, enabling safe workflow mapping through locked/unlocked pathways while preventing information silos. The protocol ensures equitable information distribution with risk as the primary consideration, creating a system that warns all users of potential risks to maintain Risk < 1 at all times. This framework integrates with existing Pi0 architecture to provide comprehensive security while maintaining compassionate information sharing.

PART 1: SECURE LEVEL ASSIGNMENT FRAMEWORK
----------------------------------------

1. Security Level Assignment Operator (SLAO):

3. Continuous Access Level Function (CALF):

   CALF(u, r) = σ(SLAO(u, r) - θ_r)
   
   Where:
   - σ is the sigmoid function: σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-k·x))
   - k is a steepness parameter controlling transition sharpness
   - CALF approaches 1 (full access) as SLAO(u, r) increases above θ_r
   - CALF approaches 0 (no access) as SLAO(u, r) decreases below θ_r

4. Security Level Evolution Equation (SLEE):

   Where:
   - Ω is the domain of all information-action pairs
   - ε is a safety margin
   - This principle ensures that the average risk across the system remains below 1 by a safety margin ε

The risk avoidance system, with its universal warning distribution and risk mitigation suggestions, ensures that the system always maintains Risk < 1, protecting all users from potential harm. The risk-reward framework for system-wide communications provides a balanced approach to information sharing that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks.

This protocol seamlessly integrates with the existing Pi0 architecture, enhancing its security capabilities while maintaining its core focus on compassionate human interaction. By implementing this protocol, the Pi0 system can provide secure, efficient workflows while ensuring that all users receive critical information in an equitable and timely manner.
