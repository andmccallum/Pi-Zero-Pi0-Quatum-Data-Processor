Abstract:
This study presents a comprehensive exploration of the G⁴=1 framework — wherein the fundamental constants G, c, ħ, and an additional constant (designated κ) are normalized to unity — as applied to π‑encoding and its implications for prime numbers, quantum gravity, and the delineation of internal and external degrees of freedom. By embedding the digits and oscillatory nature of π into field equations, we propose a modified field equation that unifies elements of number theory with physical dynamics. The framework provides insights into prime factorization and distribution through the lens of quantum gravitational modulation.

1. Introduction

In the natural unit convention of G⁴=1, we set:

    G = c = ħ = κ = 1,

which renders all physical quantities dimensionless. This unification enables direct correspondence between mathematical constants (such as π) and physical parameters, allowing for intriguing interpretations where prime numbers are seen as localized excitations or bound states within an energy landscape modulated by π‑encoding.

2. Theoretical Background

2.1 The G⁴=1 Framework

In the G⁴=1 system:

    G = c = ħ = κ = 1,

where κ may represent, for example, a string theory scale or quantum gravity parameter. In these units, length, time, and mass lose their conventional dimensions, merging into a single dimensionless framework. Such a treatment facilitates analysis of complex interactions where number theory and physics intersect.

2.2 π-Encoding and Its Physical Interpretation

π-Encoding refers to the process of injecting the sequence of π's digits into field modulation. Its transcendental, non-repeating, and oscillatory nature introduces a periodic correction into the unified field. A canonical form for the π‑modulation term is given by:

    M_π(p) = 1 + α₁ sin( (π * π_p) / β₁ ),

where:

- p is identified with a prime number or a related dynamic variable.
- π_p is a function of p (e.g., representing the p‑th digit of π or a transformation thereof).
- α₁ controls the amplitude of the oscillation.
- β₁ sets the frequency scaling.

This modulation term introduces oscillatory corrections, analogous to interference patterns, into the base field, thus linking the numeric structure of π to the fabric of space-time.
