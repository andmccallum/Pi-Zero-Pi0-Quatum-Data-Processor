PI0 GOVERNANCE MODULE - INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION
================================================

This module implements a set of self-sufficient operators to model governance structures
through the PI0 system. Built on the guiding principle g4=1, the module simulates multidimensional
interactions that include:

- Compliance and Legal Bylaws
- Human Resource Functions
- Executive Level Reporting
- Payroll and Taxation
- Community Relations (Local, Provincial, External)

Operators are implemented as classes, each with its mathematical function:

1. GovernanceComplianceOperator
   $$score = mean(data) 	imes weight$$

2. GovernancePayrollOperator
   $$score = sum(data) 	imes weight$$

3. GovernanceTaxOperator
   $$collected = sum(data) 	imes (0.15 	imes weight)$$

The module simulates governance by executing a series of iterations (simulated interactions),
where the multidimensional data represents various internal and external metrics. Results from
simulations provide insight into the balance and risk in governance operations.

The architecture is modular and selectable, meaning that users can enable or disable parts
of the governance framework based on their organizational needs.

This document, along with the underlying simulation code, is intended to allow user-groups to
self-define and adjust governance structures transparently.
