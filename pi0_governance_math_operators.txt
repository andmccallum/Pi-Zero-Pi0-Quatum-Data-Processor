1. Domain Operator Equation:
   For a given domain i:
       S_i = alpha_i * g_i(D_i)
   Example for Arts & Culture:
       S_arts = 1.0 * sqrt(sum(D_arts))

2. Composite Score Equation:
       S_composite = (1/N) * sum_{i=1}^{N} S_i

3. GPION Enhancement Equation:
       S_gpion = (S_composite)^2

Operator Definitions:
---------------------
- Arts Operator: Uses sqrt(sum(data)) as aggregation.
- Social Operator: Uses sum(data).
- Corporate Operator: Uses mean(data).
- International Operator: Uses sum(data) [simplified].
- Composite Operator: Averages the scores of the domain operators.
- GPION Operator: Squares the composite score for enhanced integration.

This framework forms the mathematical backbone of the PI0 system governance integration.
